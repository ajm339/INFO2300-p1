Design Rationale
	My website was designed to give the viewer a brief overview of who I am to give them some insight about my life.  In this particular case, my target audience is a college student who probably does not have the time or patience to read in-depth about me, therefore the content of the website is basic, short and easy to read.  The different pages are filled with colorful and warm pictures that make the viewer relaxed and interested.  The picture along with the text underneath it help to paint the picture of who I am.  The different objects on the site all have rounded corners because I believe this gives it a more informal feel along with a sense of ease.  I associate sharp corners, straight lines and plain colors with professional and serious websites.  The color scheme is composed of a color combination found on www.colorcombos.com which specifically selects colors that coordinate well together.  The tan and teal are easy on the eyes and unobtrusive, so they make up a lot of the background colors.  The bright green catches the eye, so it is used to highlight important features, such as which tab of the site the user is on.  Black and white can both be accentual and unobtrusive, so they are used as outlines and text colors to both be subtle but make a strong point as well.  Since the website is only 5 pages (4 tabs because the quiz results page does not need its own tab), I used a basic navigation bar at the top of the page without any subpages because the site does not have nor need much depth.  Finally, a simple quiz on the last tab highlights the facts displayed on the site and checks to see how much information the viewer digested from the website.
